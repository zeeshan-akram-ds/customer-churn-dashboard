- **Data Distribution Analysis** – Explore key statistics via histograms.
- **Churn Analysis by Demographics** – Understand how churn varies across different demographics.
- **Customer Tenure & Churn Trends** – Track customer retention trends.
- **Service Adoption & Churn Correlation** – Analyze churn rates by service usage.
- **Financial Metrics & Billing Analysis** – Evaluate billing patterns and their impact on churn.
- **Advanced Insights** – Deep dive into key metrics using visual analytics.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Plotly**
- **Scikit-learn** (for minor predictive modeling)
